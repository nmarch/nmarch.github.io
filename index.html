<h2>A Little Bit About Myself</h2>

<p><em>Hello!</em> My name is Nicky March and I&#39;m a student here at Eastern Washington University. I&#39;m going to school to get my bachelor&#39;s in the Visual Communication and Design program. I hope to one day work for a company whose cause I support, helping to create and establish their idenitity through my designs, whether that be through graphic design or clohting and merchandise design.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Spokane, WA. I was a student at Spokane Falls Comomunity College and worked at Pita Pit in Spokane right out of high school for about a year, where I met my now roommate Lexi, until we both left and headed for Cheney. I currently work at Pizza Hut as a delivery driver and waitress while attending class here at Eastern for the last two years. </p>

<h2>My Skillset</h2>

<ul>
<li>Web Design</li>
<li>Proficient in InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator</li>

</ul>
