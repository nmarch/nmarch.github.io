  <h1>Hello, My Name Is Nicolle</h1>

  <h2>A Little About Myself</h2>

  <p>My name is Nicky March and I'm a student here at <a href="http://www.ewu.edu/">Eastern Washington University</a>. I was born and raised in Spokane, Washington. I was a student at Spokane Falls Comomunity College and worked at Pita Pit in Spokane right
    out of high school for about a year, where I met my current roommate, until we both left and headed for Cheney. I currently work at Pizza Hut as a delivery driver and waitress while attending class here at Eastern. I have a passion for design, cats,
    video games and music.
    <br />
    <br />I'm attending school here at EWU to get my bachelor's in the <a href="http://www.ewu.edu/cstem/programs/design/design-degrees/ba-in-visual-communication-design">Visual Communication and Design program</a>. I hope to one day work for a company
    whose cause I support, helping to create and establish their idenitity through my design. Whether that be through graphic design, web design, merchandise design or logo design.
