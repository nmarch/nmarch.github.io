>## A Little Bit About Myself
> _Hello!_ My name is Nicky March and I'm a student here at Eastern Washington University. I'm going to school to get my bachelor's in the Visual Communication and Design program. I hope to one day work for a company whose cause I support, helping to create and establish their idenitity through my designs, whether that be through graphic design or clohting and merchandise design.

>I was born and raised in Spokane, WA. I was a student at Spokane Falls Comomunity College and worked at Pita Pit in Spokane right out of high school for about a year, where I met my now roommate Lexi, until we both left and headed for Cheney. I currently work at Pizza Hut as a delivery driver and waitress while attending class here at Eastern for the last two years.
